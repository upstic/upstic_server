- [X] Fixed availability controller
- [X] Fixed app.ts database initialization

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add unit tests for utilities
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Set up proper error handling
- [ ] Implement request validation pipeline

## Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Best Practices
1. Always use proper logger methods (error, warn, info, debug) based on the message type
2. Use Record<K,V> for type-safe object mappings
3. Define proper interfaces before implementing classes
4. Use enums for fixed sets of values
5. Avoid using 'any' type - create proper interfaces instead
6. Maintain consistent casing in imports (e.g., AIMatchingService vs AiMatchingService)
7. Keep model definitions in separate files
8. Use proper type exports and imports
9. Use AuthRequest interface to extend Request with user type
10. Handle unknown types safely with type guards
11. Use proper HTTP status codes in responses
12. Use singleton pattern for services that should have a single instance
13. Use proper database connection management

### Code Organization
1. Keep utility functions in separate files by category
2. Use barrel exports (index.ts) for cleaner imports
3. Follow NestJS module structure
4. Keep related functionality together
5. Use interfaces directory for shared types
6. Standardize response formats across controllers
7. Use proper dependency injection patterns
8. Keep database configuration separate from business logic

### Error Handling
1. Use custom exception classes
2. Implement proper validation pipes
3. Add proper error messages
4. Use HTTP exception filters

### Dependencies
- date-fns: ^4.1.0 (Date formatting and manipulation)
- class-validator: ^0.14.1 (Input validation)
- class-transformer: ^0.5.1 (Object transformation)
- winston: Latest (Logging)

# Current Task: Implement Availability Management

## Progress
- [X] Basic availability schema and interfaces
- [X] Availability service with core methods
- [X] Complete Availability Controller with all endpoints
- [X] Add availability validation
- [X] Add notification system for availability updates
  - [X] Create notification types
  - [X] Implement notification helper method
  - [X] Update all notification calls with proper types
  - [X] Add proper error handling
- [X] Implement recurring availability patterns
- [X] Add availability exceptions handling
- [X] Implement availability conflict detection
- [X] Add proper TypeScript types throughout service

## Lessons Learned
1. Use proper notification payload interface for type safety
2. Create helper methods for repeated notification creation
3. Use proper DTOs for input validation
4. Maintain consistent error handling patterns
5. Use proper return types for all methods

## Next Steps
1. Add availability-based job matching logic
   - [ ] Create matching algorithm considering worker availability
   - [ ] Integrate with existing job matching system
   - [ ] Add availability filters to job search

2. Add Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests for availability service
   - [ ] Integration tests for availability endpoints
   - [ ] Test notification delivery
   - [ ] Test conflict detection

3. Documentation
   - [ ] API documentation for availability endpoints
   - [ ] Usage examples
   - [ ] Integration guide for job matching

## Current Focus
Let's proceed with implementing the availability-based job matching logic. This will involve:
1. Creating a matching algorithm that considers worker availability
2. Integrating with the existing job matching system
3. Adding availability filters to job search

Would you like me to start with the job matching algorithm implementation?
