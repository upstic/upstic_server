- Availability management requires flexible recurrence rules and efficient overlap detection algorithms
- Feedback systems need comprehensive categorization, follow-up tracking, and sentiment analysis capabilities
- Notification systems require multi-channel delivery tracking and status management across different delivery methods
- **Report Template Design**: Implement a flexible report template system that separates data sources, visualizations, and layout. This allows for reusable components and easier maintenance. Include validation to ensure references between components are valid (e.g., visualizations reference existing data sources). Support for scheduling and export options enables automated reporting workflows.
- **Report Delivery Tracking**: Implement a comprehensive delivery tracking system for reports with support for multiple delivery methods (email, download, API, etc.). Track delivery status with appropriate timestamps and retry mechanisms for failed deliveries. This approach ensures reliable report distribution and provides visibility into the delivery process.
- **Preference Management System**: Implement a two-part preference system with definitions and values. Preference definitions establish the structure (type, validation, default values) while user preferences store the actual values. This separation allows for centralized management of available preferences while maintaining user-specific settings. Include scoping to organize preferences by functional area and versioning to track changes.
- **Secure Payment Method Handling**: Implement payment method storage with proper encryption for sensitive data. Store only necessary information (like last 4 digits) in plaintext and encrypt full details. Include comprehensive validation based on payment method type and automatic status updates for expired cards. Implement verification workflows to ensure payment methods are valid before use.
- **Static Methods in Mongoose Models**: When defining static methods on Mongoose models, create a separate interface that extends Model<T> and includes the static method signatures. Then use this interface as the second generic parameter when calling mongoose.model(). This ensures TypeScript properly recognizes the static methods on the model.
- **Subscription Management System**: Implement a comprehensive subscription system with support for different plan types, billing cycles, and feature tracking. Use pre-save middleware to automatically calculate next billing dates and trial end dates. Include methods for plan changes, renewals, and cancellations. Track payments and provide feature availability checking based on the subscription plan.
- **Tax Calculation Systems**: Implement a flexible tax calculation system that supports multiple tax types, jurisdictions, and exemptions. Include support for compound taxes, different calculation methods (inclusive/exclusive), and proper rounding according to financial standards. Ensure the system can handle complex scenarios like tax exemptions based on product categories, customer types, and geographical jurisdictions.
- **Report Generation Systems**: Implement a comprehensive report generation system that separates templates from generated reports. Design templates with reusable components (data sources, visualizations, sections) and implement validation to ensure references between components are valid. For report generation, support multiple output formats, delivery methods, and status tracking. Include mechanisms for scheduling reports and tracking delivery status across different channels.
- API documentation should follow OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for consistency
- Each endpoint should include proper authentication and authorization details
- Rate limiting and pagination should be implemented for list endpoints
- Error responses should follow a consistent format
- All endpoints should support proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Documentation should include practical examples and use cases
- Security considerations should be clearly documented
- API versioning strategy should be documented
- When using Mongoose aggregate pipeline with TypeScript, you need to properly type the pipeline stages and use 'as any' for complex sort expressions
- When extending both Document and a custom interface in Mongoose, use Omit<Document, conflictingProperties> to avoid property conflicts
- Always implement fallback mechanisms for service methods that might not exist in all environments

### Next Steps
The remaining models to implement focus on reporting capabilities and user preferences:
1. **ReportTemplate**: For defining report structures and data sources
2. **ReportGeneration**: For generating reports based on templates and delivering them
3. **UserPreferences**: For managing user-specific settings and preferences

## Lessons

1. **TypeScript Typing**: Always define proper interfaces for MongoDB models, including both document properties and methods. For static methods, create a separate interface that extends Model<T>.

2. **Status Fields**: Use enums for status fields to ensure consistency and type safety. This makes it easier to track state transitions and validate status changes.

3. **Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation in schema definitions and add custom validators for complex business rules.

4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling in model methods, especially for operations that might fail due to business logic constraints.

5. **Version Tracking**: Implement version tracking for critical documents to maintain history and support rollback capabilities.

6. **Localization**: For user-facing content, include fallback mechanisms and support for multiple languages.

7. **Document Lifecycle**: Implement a comprehensive lifecycle management system for documents, including creation, approval, publication, expiration, and archiving stages.

8. **Static Methods**: When implementing static methods on Mongoose models, create a separate interface that extends Model<T> to include the static method signatures, ensuring TypeScript recognizes these methods on the model.

9. **Subscription Management**: Implement a comprehensive subscription system with support for different plan types, billing cycles, and feature tracking. Use pre-save middleware for calculating billing dates and methods for plan changes, renewals, cancellations, and tracking payments.

10. **Tax Calculation Systems**: Implement a flexible tax calculation system that supports multiple tax types, jurisdictions, and exemptions. Include support for compound taxes, different calculation methods (inclusive/exclusive), and proper rounding according to financial standards. Ensure the system can handle complex scenarios like tax exemptions based on product categories, customer types, and geographical jurisdictions.

11. **Report Generation Systems**: Implement a comprehensive report generation system that separates templates from generated reports. Design templates with reusable components (data sources, visualizations, sections) and implement validation to ensure references between components are valid. For report generation, support multiple output formats, delivery methods, and status tracking. Include mechanisms for scheduling reports and tracking delivery status across different channels.

2. Integrate with the main application module
3. Add documentation for the API endpoints

### Lessons
- When implementing notification methods, ensure consistent naming across services
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all service methods
- Ensure DTOs have proper validation decorators from class-validator
- Use @Type decorator from class-transformer for Date fields to ensure proper transformation
- Make all fields in UpdateDto classes optional with @IsOptional decorator
- For filter DTOs, include array fields with @IsArray and { each: true } for enum validation
- When working with Mongoose models, use the correct type for the model by combining Model<DocumentType> with any static methods interface
- When Mongoose's save() method returns a Document that doesn't match your expected type, use type assertion with `as unknown as YourType` to tell TypeScript the correct type
- Use .exec() at the end of Mongoose queries to ensure they return a proper Promise
- When creating controllers, use appropriate decorators from @nestjs/swagger for API documentation
- Use HttpCode decorator to set the appropriate HTTP status code for responses
- For endpoints that don't return content (like DELETE), use HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT
- Ensure all model files properly import their corresponding interfaces and schemas
- Organize related components into feature modules for better code organization and maintainability
- When a DTO has optional fields but the interface requires non-optional fields, provide default values when mapping from DTO to interface
- Use the nullish coalescing operator (??) to provide defaults for optional fields while preserving explicit `false` values
- When working with MongoDB, remember to convert string IDs to ObjectIds using `new Types.ObjectId(stringId)` when assigning to fields typed as ObjectId
- For authenticated requests in Express with NestJS, create a custom interface that extends the Request type with a properly typed user property: `interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Omit<Request, 'user'> { user: JwtPayload; }`
